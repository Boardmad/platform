- use "notifyOnClose" handler to report a connection failure due to unloaded db app
- add constraints to Timer and Clock injected by the web/db apps
- test certificate revocation/removal with Let's Encrypt
- always start registration with "self" provider (to create a temporary key) before "renewing"
  with certbot; alternatively we can simply disallow passing a provider into "register" API

- consider a possibility of multi-certificate "host", e.g. "host.cvs.com.xqiz.it" and
  "xtc-host.cvs.com" both pointing to the same Azure hosted "xtc-host.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com"
