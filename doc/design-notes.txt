* need fast access to current state
* need history

security issues to incorporate:
* 2FA
* password info
* tokens
* client side cert (and is it required?)
* browser fingerprint
* gen a new token at login, place it into the session, and correlate it with IP & fingerprint (?) - but carefully avoid
  using it for tracking info (i.e. use it to help secure the user's data, but do not allow it to be used to track the user)

Identity -> one of: a Person, a Token, the system

Person : Identity
- created : Date
- name
- legalName
  - confirmed
- emails ->  has one or more email addresses
- phones ->  has one or more phone numbers
- confirmations -> some sort of records of various details about the person
- changes -> some sort of audit list of changes
- orgs

Token : Identity
- description: identifies a process created and authorized by a human being
- login -> identifies the identity that created the token

System : Identity

enum ContactType {None, Critical, Notify, Marketing, ThirdParty}

enum Verified{NoAttempt, Pending, Verified, Failed} // REVIEW

Email
- address
- Login (optional)
- confirmed (date)
- allow contact: notifications, marketing, third party
* assume that this provides history: what has been sent and received

Phone
- number
- usedBy        : Person[]
- voiceEnabled  : ContactType
- voiceVerified : Verified
- voiceConfirmed: Date
- voiceHistory  : ? (calls logged in and out, notes, recordings, whatever)
- textEnabled   : ContactType
- textVerified  : Verified
- textConfirmed : Date
- textHistory   : ? (what has been sent and received)

Organization
- name       : String
- description: String
- created    : Date
- createdBy  : Person
- category   : {Personal, Association, Team, Management, Corporation}  ; REVIEW
- parent     : Organization?
- people     : Person[]
- orgs       : Organization[]
* assets
* need some mapping from responsibility (and/or "grants") to people
* account status (red/yellow/green)
* history (perhaps just a link to the previous version of the org? and who changed it?)

DomainName
- uri       : URI
- temp      : Boolean       ; a temporary domain, e.g. "12345.app" maps (only) to "12345.app.xqiz.it"
- ownedBy   : Organization

What do I want to see when I land?

Questions that I can ask:
* what are my domains?
* what are my apps?
* what's in production? what's not?
* are there any problems? what notifications do I have from the apps?
* what things are "pending"? e.g. approval for domains I've claimed, processes I've kicked off
* what are my projects? (perhaps correlated to branches)
* what are my teams / orgs?
* switch context from one org to another, or from one project to another

== app hosting ==

* what is an application?
* application state (e.g. database)

code
- displayName
- description
- owner       : Organization
- moduleName
- hash                      ; some way to de-dup?
- license[]                 ; list of possible licenses?
