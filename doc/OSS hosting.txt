### OSS hosting (assuming renting VMs on Azure)

    - there is one ond only one hosting domain, specified in the configuration file or during the first
        startup, e.g.: "eastus.cloudapp.azure.com"; that must be accessible and controlled
        by the customer, which means that the customer must be able to create DNS records for
        names that end with "eastus.cloudapp.azure.com" associating those names with the same real
        IP address; the hosting server will be bound to a name that starts with "xtc-platform"
        and ends with the hosting domain (i.e.: "xtc-platform.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com")

    - there is one ond only one account called "self", used for the hosting applications

    - there is one and only one user called "admin", used for registering and administering
      application deployments; the password for "admin" is selected during the first startup and
      must be supplied later on; changing the password is possible later on using admin tools

    - applications are deployed under subdomains that *must be* controlled by the customer,
        e.g.: "products.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com"; the customer must be able to create DNS records
        associating those names with the same IP address as the xtc-platform hosting address above

    - the admin panel (UI) should allow:
        - upload XTC modules
        - registering XTC modules deployments under customer controlled sub-domain names
        - configuring and deploying registered modules
        - issuing tokens for REST based management API that allows
            -- change the "admin" user password
            -- define configuration parameters for registered applications
